# API
Our API is built on [Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/), and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).
We have chosen these technologies to provide an example for the Government of Canada with the use of a GraphQL
API rather than the traditional REST API.

### Installing Dependencies
Run pipenv installer in api directory

```pipenv install```

### Running the API

```pipenv run server```

### Accessing the API
