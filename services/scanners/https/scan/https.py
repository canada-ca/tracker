    If values are passed in to this function, they will be assigned to

    It also potentially allows clients to pass in subsets of these lists,

    Otherwise, if the --cache-third-parties=[DIR] flag specifies a directory,
    all downloaded third party data will be cached in a directory, and
    used from cache on the next pshtt run instead of hitting the network.
    If no values are passed in, and no --cache-third-parties flag is used,
    then no cached third party data will be created or used, and pshtt will
