# Istio

This folder contains the config for [Istio](https://istio.io/latest/), which acts as the ingress gateway for the Tracker system.

Istio is managed by the [istio operator](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/operator/) and we are supplying a CRD to describe to the operator our desired configuration.

## Installing `istioctl`

The `istioctl` command needs to be available in your PATH. Instructions for installing it are on the [Istio website](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/#download).

## Updating the Istio config

The config found in `platform/components/istio/istio.yaml` is generated by the `make update-istio` command. After installing a new version of `istioctl` you should rerun this command to update the that file.
