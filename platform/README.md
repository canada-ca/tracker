# Platform manifests

This folder contains the Custom Resource Definitions that the Tracker app relies on, as well as "infrastructure" stuff like Istio, that really is independent from our application.

As an example, the Tracker app uses a `Certificate` object to acquire a TLS certificate. 

```
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: ingress-cert
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  commonName: tracker.alpha.canada.ca
  dnsNames:
  - tracker.alpha.canada.ca
  - suivi.alpha.canada.ca
  issuerRef:
    kind: Issuer
    name: selfsigned
  privateKey:
    algorithm: RSA
    encoding: PKCS8
    size: 4096
  secretName: tracker-credential
status: {}
```

`Certificate` is not a native Kubernetes object and is just assumed to exist in the environment. The manifests in this folder are all about defining generic objects like `Certificate` that the app can rely on without knowing how it got there.
