# Base manifests

This folder contains the base manifests that [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) will add to or patch using the contents of the overlay folders.

The only real thing of note here is the `istio.yaml` file, which was generated by the following command:

```bash
istioctl manifest generate --set values.global.jwtPolicy=first-party-jwt --set values.kiali.enabled=true --set values.tracing.enabled=true --set values.pilot.traceSampling=100 --set meshConfig.accessLogFile="/dev/stdout" > istio.yaml
```

At the moment the istio service opens a few more ports than we actually want to expose, so after running the above command you will need to remove the offending ports from the service definition so the ingress gateway doesn't open them. That means editing the istio.yaml and removing the following:

```bash
 apiVersion: v1
 kind: Service
 metadata:
   annotations: null
   labels:
     app: istio-ingressgateway
     istio: ingressgateway
     release: istio
   name: istio-ingressgateway
   namespace: istio-system
 spec:
   ports:
-  - name: status-port
-    port: 15021
-    targetPort: 15021
   - name: http2
     port: 80
     targetPort: 8080
   - name: https
     port: 443
     targetPort: 8443
-  - name: tls
-    port: 15443
-    targetPort: 15443
   selector:
     app: istio-ingressgateway
     istio: ingressgateway
   type: LoadBalancer
```

There is another `istio.yaml` in the GKE overlay folder that patches this config with settings needed for our GKE environment.
